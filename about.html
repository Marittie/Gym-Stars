            <p>Hi, I am Mario and I have been a sport passionate since a young age. In the past years I focused myself on Gym workouts. 
                I have been experimenting with different workout types according to a timely manner, having a full time job and other different life commitments which are common factors for a lot of people. </p>
                <hr>
            <p>This is without any doubts the most efficient workout to get with you throughout as many years as you want just changing the weight load as you go forward and it hits each group muscle type 2 times a week with great intensity. 
                It is suitable for everyone, no matter at what level you are at, from beginner to advanced.</p>
                <hr>
            <p>Important to warm up before every session with some light cardio and few dynamic exercises,
                 rest 1 minute between each set and stretch out the muscle you have worked on at the end of the session. </p> 
                 <hr>
            <p>Pairing healthy and balanced nutrition, and getting enough sleep, will help you not only to see the results for which you are committing your body at,
                 but it also helps to have more energy and to stay more focused throughout your days. </p> 
                 <hr>
            <p>I have been helping out friends and colleagues suggesting this workout and exercising together, getting great feedback and great results.
                Working out together with friends or in a group helps to stay motivated and to challenge yourself even more as you see more people committing to the same goal.
                It is now my goal to get to as many people as I can to achieve their goals and to feel great as I feel thanks to this amazing workout plan. 
                </p>
